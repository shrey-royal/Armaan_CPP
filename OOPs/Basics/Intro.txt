OOPs : Object Oriented Programming System

In OOPs we have 4 main concepts
    1. Inheritance: It is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
    2. Polymorphism: It is a concept by which we can perform a single action by different ways.
    3. Abstraction: It is a concept of hiding the internal details and describing things in simple terms.
    4. Encapsulation: It is a concept of binding data and functions that manipulate the data.

Object Oriented Programming System is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

Q. What is a Class?
A. A class is a blueprint for the object. 
Example: A School is a class and students are the objects.

A Class is a user defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.

Q. What is an Object?
A. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.


Example OF Class and Object: 

When i say i bought a television from the market, i mean i bought an object of the class television. Television is a class and the television i bought is an object of that class. Similarly, when i say i bought a shirt from the market, i mean i bought an object of the class shirt. Shirt is a class and the shirt i bought is an object of that class.

class -> object
Car -> BMW X5

A Class is a Logical Entity. It is a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.

An Object is a Physical Entity. It is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.
